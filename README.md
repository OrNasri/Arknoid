# Arknoid

Arknoid game project written in Java as project in OOP course at Bar-Ilan University.
Using OOP basic design principles and GUI.

# Levels
The game has 3 different Levels:
1. Direct hit- one ball, one block: need to hit the block with a clean shot.
2. FinalFour - three balls , classic level.
3. Green3 - two balls, classic level.

Each hitted block will give you 100 points and passing a level, each round will give you an additional bonus points.

# How to run it?

1. go to folder directory and enter cmd. 
2. enter - ant compile. 
3. enter : ant run + {levels numbers}, (numbers level between 1-4, for exmaple: ant run 3 1 1 4)
4. for default game, enter: ant run (for default levels).
